    <p>Winter is the coldest season among all the seasons in India. It is the season between Autumn and Spring. During
        this time, the day becomes shorter and night becomes longer. The Sunbray falls towards the South pole, thus the
        north pole remains comparatively cooler. In this time period, people wear warm clothes like sweaters, mufflers,
        socks, jackets, coats etc.. This is a pleasant season. In North India snowfall also occurs at this time.</p>
